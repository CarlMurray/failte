# Bugs and Issues
- Failte Ireland API is paginated and returns 50 results at a time. Documentation non-existant at time of writing. Downloaded CSV of data and converted to JSON using [CSVtoJSON](https://csvjson.com/csv2json)
- Not a bug, but very challenging getting search function working correctly. Flow chart helped to think through code logic and identify issues. https://www.smartdraw.com/flowchart/flowchart-maker.htm
