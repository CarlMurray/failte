# Bugs and Issues

- During the initial stage of development, when fetching the Attraction Data from the FÃ¡ilte Ireland API, it would only return a maximum of 50 results as results are paginated. Documentation for the API is non-existant/inaccessible at time of writing and I could not determine a solution. However, I was able to download the full dataset in CSV format which I could then parse to JSON using [CSVtoJSON](https://csvjson.com/csv2json) and `fetch` the file locally which turned out to be a simpler and better solution.
- The biggest challenge was implementing the search feature so that it functions as desired. During development, I was able to make Attractions which matched the search query appear on the map, however when I cleared or editted the search input, the Attractions remained on the map as I had not told the program to clear the map when a new search query is made. Drawing up a flowchart helped me think through the logic of my code and the issue and solution became obvious after doing this.

- When testing on an iPhone XS Max, it was noted that the site did not fit within the viewport as intended. This was due to `vh` units not taking into account the native browser UI elements such as the toolbar etc. I found a solution on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58886797/how-to-access-the-real-100vh-on-ios-in-css): a newer CSS unit - `dvh` (Dynamic Viewport Units) - takes into account the browser UI and changing any `vh` units in my CSS to `dvh` fixed this issue and the site now displays as intended. This was tested on all major mobile browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox, Opera, DuckDuckGo) wihtout issue.

- After implementing the search functionality, I tested it on an iPhone XS Max and it would not return any search results. I found that the iPhone keyboard was automatically setting the first character to uppercase, and I had not made the search query function case-insensitive. This was fixed by simply adding `.toLowerCase()` to the `searchQuery` argument in my app.
